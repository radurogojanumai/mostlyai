The **Synthetic Data SDK** is a Python toolkit for high-fidelity, privacy-safe **Synthetic Data**.

- **LOCAL** mode trains and generates synthetic data locally on your own compute resources.
- **CLIENT** mode connects to a remote MOSTLY AI platform for training & generating synthetic data there.
- Generators, that were trained locally, can be easily imported to a platform for further sharing.

## Overview 

The SDK allows you to programmatically create, browse and manage 3 key resources:

1. **Generators** - Train a synthetic data generator on your existing tabular or language data assets
2. **Synthetic Datasets** - Use a generator to create any number of synthetic samples to your needs
3. **Connectors** - Connect to any data source within your organization, for reading and writing data

## Quick Start <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/mostly-ai/mostlyai/blob/main/docs/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started.ipynb" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-Colab-blue?logo=google-colab" alt="Run on Colab"></a>

Install the SDK via pip:

```shell
pip install mostlyai
```

Train your first generator:

```python
import pandas as pd
from mostlyai.sdk import MostlyAI

# load original data
repo_url = "https://github.com/mostly-ai/public-demo-data/raw/refs/heads/dev"
df_original = pd.read_csv(f"{repo_url}/census/census.csv.gz")

# initialize the SDK
mostly = MostlyAI()

# train a synthetic data generator
g = mostly.train(
    config={
        "name": "US Census Income",
        "tables": [
            {
                "name": "census",
                "data": df_original,
                "tabular_model_configuration": {  # tabular model configuration (optional)
                    "max_training_time": 1,       # - cap time to 1 min for demo; increase for max accuracy
                    # model, max_epochs,,..       # further model configurations (optional)
                    # 'differential_privacy': {   # differential privacy configuration (optional)
                    #     'max_epsilon': 5.0,     # - max epsilon value, used as stopping criterion
                    #     'delta': 1e-5,          # - delta value
                    # }
                },
                # columns, keys, compute,..       # further table configurations (optional)
            }
        ],
    },
    start=True,  # start training immediately (default: True)
    wait=True,  # wait for completion (default: True)
)

# display the quality assurance report
g.reports(display=True)
```

Once the generator has been trained, generate synthetic data samples. Either via probing:

```python
# probe for some representative synthetic samples
df_samples = mostly.probe(g, size=100)
df_samples
```

or by creating a synthetic dataset entity for larger data volumes:

```python
# generate a large representative synthetic dataset
sd = mostly.generate(g, size=100_000)
df_synthetic = sd.data()
df_synthetic
```

or by conditionally probing / generating synthetic data:

```python
# create 100 seed records of 24y old Mexicans
df_seed = pd.DataFrame({
    'age': [24] * 100,
    'native_country': ['Mexico'] * 100,
})
# conditionally probe, based on provided seed
df_samples = mostly.probe(g, seed=df_seed)
df_samples
```

## Installation

 Use `pip` (or better `uv pip`) to install the official `mostlyai` package via PyPI. Python 3.10 or higher is required. It is recommended to install the package within a dedicated virtual environment.

### CLIENT mode

This is a light-weight installation for using the SDK in CLIENT mode only. It communicates to a MOSTLY AI platform to perform requested tasks. See e.g. [app.mostly.ai](https://app.mostly.ai/) for a free-to-use hosted version.

```shell
pip install -U mostlyai
```

### CLIENT + LOCAL mode

This is a full installation for using the SDK in both CLIENT and LOCAL mode. It includes all dependencies, incl. PyTorch, for training and generating synthetic data locally.

```shell
# for CPU on macOS
pip install -U 'mostlyai[local]'
# for CPU on Linux
pip install -U 'mostlyai[local-cpu]' --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
# for GPU on Linux
pip install -U 'mostlyai[local-gpu]'
```

Add any of the following extras for further data connectors support in LOCAL mode: `databricks`, `googlebigquery`, `hive`, `mssql`, `mysql`, `oracle`, `postgres`, `snowflake`. E.g.

```shell
pip install -U 'mostlyai[local, databricks, snowflake]'
```
